### Context:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

This was the first time we wrote HTML, CSS, and Javascript in one project. We were able to use the knowledge in class to build a functional site. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

This was an exciting project to work on since it was solo I was able to feel more confident in what I've learned so far. It was fun writing our own HTML and CSS for the first time and really seeing how they all interact together. 

The first challenge I encountered was using FlexBox to help build out the comp. Though after watching more videos and just practicing with the concept I was able to create the two mirrored squares. The second challenge that occured was hiding the box that contained the dish recommendation. At first, I thought I had to create an event listener for when the window loads but after researching and looking at a previous project I determined a more efficent solution.
