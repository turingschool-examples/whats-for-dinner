## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

//change the page when the project is fully complete.
## Illustrations
  ![What's For Dinner?]()

## Features
- Any of the radio buttons chosen will output a specific item from that array.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the "Entire Meal Functionality". Each button will output random items (side, main dish, dessert) OR one of each for a meal idea for any user clicking the buttons.

## Deployed Page

Visit our published Hang In There Site! [here](https://jdeloach03.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)

## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page would be super cool, if it were responsive in a sense of allowing users login to be saved/recipe ideas they like to be stored within their page.
