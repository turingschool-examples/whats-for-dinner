### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

// I built a website that allows for a user to randomly generate dish suggestions (sides, mains, desserts) and can combine all three into an entire meal suggeestion. The functionality of the website allows the user pick from a predetermined bank of suggestions and answer's the question, what's for dinner?

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

They'd have to fork and clone my repository and install the index.html, main.js, and html docs on their local machine. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I probably put 20 hours into this project. It is week 4 of mod1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

Get practice with html, css, javascript, and manipulating the DOM. I used a lot of google and brainstorming with fellow students (pseudocoding) to gain an understanding of the direction I was going to go in.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

I feel like I overcame my aversion to css, I learned a ton about HTML and how its elements interact with other languages, and I feel like I get the big picture of coding now. I spent a lot of time on flexbox and gaining understanding of it, but not without a lot of pain and frustration which was ultimately a good teacher.
