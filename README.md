## Overview

This application assists users with choosing what to have for dinner! Users can choose to display a randomly picked side dish, main dish, dessert or entire meal by selecting one of the options on the left and clicking the 'Let's Cook!' button. The user can clear the displayed text by clicking the 'Clear' button if they no longer want to see it. What are you still reading this for? Let's get cooking! 

## Setup
  
- Clone this repository down to your local machine
- Navigate into the directory
- Run `open index.html` in your terminal

## Deploy Link

## Future Additions
I'd like to add a login page at somepoint and also include some functionality for error handling.
