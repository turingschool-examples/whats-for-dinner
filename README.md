# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built an application that allows a user to choose from a variety of meal types and receive a suggestion on what to cook based on the users choice.   The user can choose from sides, desserts, main dishes and a total meal that selects a choice from all three catagories.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
A person can fork this repository and copy the SSH location to paste in their console. With a copy of the SSH a person just needs to run git clone "SSH copy", and then cd into the new files.  After moving into the cloned files the final step is to run open index.html for the browser to open and allow access to the app.  

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
The screen shot shows the selection of a meal that pulls from all of the three catagories.  This image also displays the challenge of removing a SVG image and replacing it with the display of the entire meal.  


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I just finished the 3rd week of Mod1.  I spent several days completing this project.  I started by creating an HTML framework and then using CSS to create the visual look I was aiming for.  Finally I worked through the JavaScript functionality to give the user the experience I was hoping for.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I created an application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that is functional. 

Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.

I wrote HTML and CSS that closely matched the comp provided and added some additional functionality. 

Understand how to listen to and respond to user events.

I used radio buttons in combination with eventListeners to create the functionality I was looking for.  

Individualize your programming skill set.

I extended my learing by adding additional functionality to the application.  I enabled the user to create a main dish which required merging the results from the 3 catagories.  I also worked on the display features within CSS to hide and unhide images when specific items are selected.  

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I struggled for a long time trying how to create the functionality to hide items within CSS.  I went back and forth between visibility and display properties and understanding how they differ.  I learned how to use the dev-tools functionality in the browser to acheive the display features I wanted.  Struggling with the CSS displays I wanted helped with undersanding how my HTML impacts what I can do within CSS.
