### Introduction

Do you struggle with making decisions? Have you wasted countless minutes of your life
stuck in the "What do you wanna eat?", "I don't know,
what do you want?" loop with family and friends? Do you wish a button could just answer that question for you so you can turn your attention to more important things, like actually making the food? Well, friend, you've come to the right place!
