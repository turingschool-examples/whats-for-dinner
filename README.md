### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was kicked off and given to Mod 1 students on the 3rd week. I started building the structure of the website using HTML and gave it some functionality using javascript language. The added aesthetic was created through the use off CSS and the available image provided in the folder when forked from Turing's original repo.
