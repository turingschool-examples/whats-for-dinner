### Context:
[//]: <> I was given 5 days to complete this project. This was the first project where students weren't given any HTML CSS or JS to start. Outside of the background image and svg file all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript was written and tested by me. I am currently 3 weeks into Mod 1 of Turing.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> This was a solo project. As I stated previously the entire application was completed on my own.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The main goal of this project was to become familiar and comfortable writing both CSS and HTML on our own. There were also JavaScript aspects that built off of previous projects incorporated into Whats-for-Dinner. I learned how to utilize flexbox, css styles, and HTML structure. One of the largest aspects of this project was utilizing the data model to restructure the DOM and display different elements of the data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <>
- Challenge; CSS measurement types: There are many ways to utilize the space on your screen and hardcoding them using pixels for a measurement is most-often not the best technique. I have many CSS elements that incorporate % and vh but not all of them. In the future I want to exclusively use % or vh.
- Win; Data Model: The 'favorites' feature incorporates my Data Model and allows me to manipulate the DOM. Although the concept of not being able to directly manipulate my data model as though it was apart of HTML file is still new, I was able to utilize the DOM to display different aspect of my data model and store values that weren't originally there.
