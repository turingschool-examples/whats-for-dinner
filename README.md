# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
For our second website project in Mod 1, we built the 'What's for Dinner?' page to make random reciped suggestions based on a user's radio button selection.  This was the first project where we built our own HTML structure and CSS styling files to recreate a comp that was provided for us.  We then used JavaScript to add the interactive radio buttons, create functionality, and keep our Data Model up to date.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
The What's for Dinner project was our second website project was assigned to us in the 3rd week of Mod 1.  It required about 16 hours of work over a 5 day period, and this project had us create the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality and interactivity.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- gain experience building an application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- write both HTML and CSS to match a comp that was provided
- understand and gain experience with how to listen to and respond to user events
- individualize my programming skill set through a Choose Your Own Adventure feature
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins
1. The first win was getting my HTML structure set up correctly!  I had very little experience with HTML structure and we only had 1 lesson about it.
2. Another win was getting the styling to look like the comp!  We also didn't have a lot of time learning CSS, but the flexbox lecture was a HUGE help.

#### Challenges
1. Figuring out how to 'listen' to the radio buttons took some time to figure out
2. Getting all of the components to line up exactly where I wanted them took some time, especially because I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to the visible page.
3. I'm still making mistakes with adding Pull Requests to the Turing School repo instead of my fork!
