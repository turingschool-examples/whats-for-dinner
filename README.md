# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
- This user-friendly app suggests recipes for sides, mains, and desserts. Users can individually select which course they want a recipe for or they can select an entire meal. Additionally, users can clear the recipe suggestions with the click of a button. If a user hasn’t selected one of the meal options and clicks the “Let’s cook” button, a message will appear letting the user know they first need to select a dish.

### Installation Instructions:
1. git clone this repo to your local machine
2. cd into that directory
3. git open index.html to open the browser
4. Have fun making meals!

### Context:
- The project was introduced 5 days before the due date. I dedicated time to work on the project outside of class each of the 5 days. I have completed 3 weeks of Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
- This was the second time that I worked on an actual application that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My learning goal was not only to create a landing page identical to the mockup using HTML and CSS, but also to add functionality to the radio inputs and buttons with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I wanted to use and grow my understanding of functions that rely on a user event in the browser. I also wanted to get more practice using git commands, pushing code into the remote repo and pulling it back down to my local machine.


### Wins + Challenges:
- Playing Flexbox Froggy before applying the concept of flexbox in my project helped improve my understanding of how to align elements and distribute space within a container. 
- Learning about radio buttons and using .checked to determine if they are selected was a satisfying research project.
- I enjoyed figuring out I could use the bang operator and && in my conditional statement to simplify when no radio buttons are checked a message is displayed telling the user to make a selection.
Using text-transform: uppercase; in CSS to affect the innerText in my HTML

- Looking at a prompt and determining where to start and what tools to use is still quite challenging for me, especially when there isn’t existing code to start. 
- Although I knew I needed to create a function that generates a random number and use that function inside of another function to randomize the string elements inside of the sides, mains, and desserts arrays, I had difficulty putting the pieces together which cost me time in the beginning. With guidance from my mentor and my rock, I was able to complete this step.
