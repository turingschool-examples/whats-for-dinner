### Learning Goals:
  + Use HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
  + Strengthen understanding of the DOM vs. the Data Model.
  + Strengthen ability to listen and react to user input.
  + Introduce error handling.

### Wins + Challenges:
Successes includes: easily identifying where I could integrate error handling and entire meal presentation into code, as I was pseudocoding it out. Struggles mostly pertained to CSS and trying to orient elements correctly without pushing each other off the page.
