# What's for Dinner?!?!

**It's the question that's on everyone's mind at the end of the night!**

If this is a question that lingers in *YOUR* brain at the end of the night, then look no further!!!

Please, visit my website: [What's For Dinner?](https://jfarelli.github.io/whats-for-dinner/)

* Whether you need an idea for a **Side**, a **Main Dish**, a **Dessert**, or **ALL OF THEM**, just select what you need and hit that **"Get Cooking"** button!

* That little stove pot on the right will disappear and be replaced with a random meal!

* Is that option not for you??? Just keep on hitting that **"Get Cooking"** button and see which meal "tickles your fancy"!

* BON APPETIT!!
