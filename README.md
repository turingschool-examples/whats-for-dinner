# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

### Personal Goals

- Have better naming conventions when it comes to class and variable assigning.
- Better organization.  Considering sectioning off code.
- Discover new ways to affect the design of my page with CSS.
- Do more commits and pushes up to GitHun.

### Summary

- I started designing my application with HTML by building the places that I wanted my text, images, and buttons to go.  Once, I had the layout of my tags down and IDs and classes assigned, I started coding my CSS.  I made four sections based on the lay out of the page: top, middle, bottom, and utilities.  I started from the top to the bottom and adding utilities as I went.  After designing the look of my application, I moved over to Javascript and wrote the food arrarys, query selectors, event listeners and then funtions of my page.


### Challenges

- Remembering to commit and push up my work to GitHun
- CSS: _"Choose your own adventure"_, was very challenging trying to apply it to my page.  I did not fully finish the challenge but I did most of it.
- CSS: Understanding when and where to place things.  Using percentages versus pixels quantification.
