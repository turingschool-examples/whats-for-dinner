# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The website lands you on a login page, where the user gives there name, and is then directed to a page where they can select between 3 different dishes. Depending on the dish the user selects, they will get a randomized dish from the correlating array. They can clear the dish and select a new dish if they want to.

(refer to png file under the explorer)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I finished week 3 of Mod1. The app took approximately 8 hours off HTML & CSS, and another 6 hours of Javascript. I kept breaking code, and had some struggles navigating some issues.   

### Contributors:

Solo project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals was to gain familiarity with creating CSS and HTML. Also how CSS, HTML and Javascript all interact with each other.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins: I was able to complete the iteration and the prompt I chose. I have a better understanding of how to create HTML and CSS. 

I struggled with CSS and creating elements and classes within HTML. I was having a some issues with javascript and when I started utilizing the DEV Tools, I was able to spot where the issues were occuring and make the adjustments necessary. If I utilized the DEV Tools sooner, I would have had an easier experience.
