## Introduction
What's for dinner? The ultimate question.

What's for dinner is a webpage with functional html, css elements, and javascript that allows
the user to have a food item randomly selected based on their choice.

## Project Information
#### Goals
- To utilize html and css to match a visual comp provided
- To implement functional, dynamic, and DRY code in each iteration completed
- To apply foundational knowledge of Javascript in conjunction with CSS and HTML
- To learn how to pace time for a solo project and see measure technical growth

## Reflections

 This project taught me a lot about css for future projects.  There were a lot of hurdles, and I am glad I attempted to do the css CYOA although I didn't successfully finish the bullet points.  

 I found that the CYOA for the error handling and entire meal option lent themselves to the css, so I implemented those functionalities as well.  

 I learned that for css dynamic sizing helps with changing layouts based on device.  Due to some of my
 early project coding choices it was difficult to implement a very fluid responsive layout.  Certain elements would go out of place depending on the max width.  In the future I will keep dynamic sizing and parenting in mind when building out comps.

 If I was going to build out all the CYOA items, I would probably remake the comp from scratch with resizing in mind.  I learned that I enjoy working with javascript functionality and problem solving a lot, and in my next solo I am hoping to work on those skills more.
