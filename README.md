# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a functional webpage that gives the user options to select a dish (side, main or dessert) that they would like to make and output a random answer for them. The app is solving the age old question of what to eat. It is solving it by providing the user an answer as to what to eat.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had from Tuesday- Sunday to work on the project. However, I had to move during the project so I didn't complete the CYOA portion. I am three weeks into the program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of the project were to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create the website as well as really hone in the skills for event listeners. The learning goals were to not copy code and work through it individually and do independent research. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
My biggest win was getting the radio button functionality to work using interpolation so I didn't have a huge code block. Another win I had was utilizing CSS to make the webpage match the comp. My biggest challenge was not referring to old code and realizing that this does nothign for my learning, and that I was able to complete it without doing that. My other biggest challenge was moving during this project. I had to accept that I wasn't able to finish the CYOA portion and let go of the disappointment I felt in myself and accepting I didn't have a choice since I had to move.
